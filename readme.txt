This CMS system originated as a project management tool, but has accidentally grown into a system with potential to create any type of data-based application.

This implementation allows you to create comes pre-loaded with the ability to book a restaurant table and track diners through a restaurant. 

It also adds a front end validation class for all field types - which I will later port to the main trunk.

Please see the Universal CMS project for details of how the system is put together or for a fresh build.
